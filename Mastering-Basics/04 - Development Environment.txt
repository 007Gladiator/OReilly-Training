Mastering Relational SQL Querying
Development Environment Setup
-------------------------------------------

Go to http://sqlitebrowser.org/
Download and install the version for your O/S
* Installation instructions on home page

Launch DB Browser for SQLite.
Click 'New Database'.
Select a folder and name for your database file.
* Note - This example will be a tiny file, don't worry about space considerations

The client will launch the CREATE TABLE wizard automatically.
Type 'MyFirstTable' in the name text box.

Click 'Add Field'.
* Note - in most RDBMS the term is a 'column'. However, since SQLite does not enforce domain integrity, it is unfortunately a 'field', like in a spreadsheet
Type 'KeyColumn' in the field name text box.
Leave the domain data type at the default type 'INTEGER'.
Check the 'Not NULL' and 'Primary Key' check boxes.

Click 'Add Field'.
Type 'AttributeColumn' in the field name text box.
Change the domain data type to 'TEXT'.
Check the 'Not NULL' check box.

Examine the SQL statement that was automatically generated for you by the wizard.
Click 'OK'

Click the 'Browse Data' tab, the table is still empty of course.
Click 'New Record'
* Note that the term 'Record' is wrong. In a relational database, the term is a 'Row'.
Enter the values '1' and 'A' for both Columns respectively and click 'New Record'.
* NOTE - you must press 'Enter' after inserting a value for each cell.
* NOTE - Do not type the values in the filter field, use the empty text boxes right below it.
Enter the values '2' and 'B' for both Columns respectively and press 'Enter'.

Explore the various tabs that the tool offers.

Click 'Write Changes' 
* Note - Your changes are not committed to the database file until you click 'Write Changes'.

Click 'File -> Close Database' (or CTRL+W).

Click 'File' and select your database from the list of 3 recently used files (or CTRL+1).
Click the 'Browse Data' tab and make sure your table values are still there.

Congratulations! 
You successfully created your first database!
